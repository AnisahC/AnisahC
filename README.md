<h1>👋 Hi, I'm Anisah!</h1>
<b>

I’m a 4th-year Computer Science student passionate about technology and learning. My academic journey has included courses in UNIX Programming, Database Management, Operating Systems, and Software Engineering, equipping me with a solid foundation in the field.

I thrive on exploring new technologies and enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems. I also love working on team projects, as I believe collaboration enhances creativity and leads to better solutions. Engaging with others to share ideas and learn together is something I truly enjoy.
